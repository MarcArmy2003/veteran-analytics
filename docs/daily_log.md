### ‚úÖ Accomplishments & Key Decisions

* **Objective 1:** Successfully diagnose and solve the persistent `FileNotFoundError` that was preventing the Python data processing script from running.
* **Decision:** The root cause of the execution errors was identified as a likely conflict with the Microsoft OneDrive sync folder. The definitive solution is to move the script and its source data (`XLS_TO_PROCESS` folder) to a simple, local directory (`C:\VISTA_TEMP`) before execution.
* **Code Created/Modified:** Finalized the `definitive_chunker.py` script to read `.xls` files directly, convert all sheets to Markdown, and save the output to a dedicated folder, automating the entire data cleaning pipeline.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Roadblocks

* **Issue:** The Python script `definitive_chunker.py` was consistently failing with a `FileNotFoundError`, even when the file was confirmed to be in the correct directory and executed with an absolute path. This pointed to an issue beyond a simple pathing mistake.
* **Solution:** We bypassed the problem by creating a local, non-synced folder (`C:\VISTA_TEMP`) and running the script from there. This confirmed that the OneDrive folder was the source of the file system conflict, providing a reliable workaround for all future script executions.

### üöÄ Next Steps

* **Immediate Goal:** Run the `definitive_chunker.py` script from the `C:\VISTA_TEMP` directory to process all the source `.xls` files.
* **Future Goal:** After the script successfully converts all files, copy the cleaned `.txt` files from the output folder back into the main `VISTA_Repository`, sync the repository with Google Cloud Storage, and trigger a `MANUAL SYNC` in Vertex AI to complete the data ingestion.
