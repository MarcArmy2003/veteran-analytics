# GPT Actions

This folder contains OpenAPI specifications and schema files for GPT-based actions that support the Veteran Analytics platform.

## Contents

Currently this folder only contains this `README.md` file. Additional OpenAPI
specifications and schemas will be added as the project evolves.

Each file defines callable tools designed to work with natural language interfaces, structured data, and VA-specific domain logic.
